# Future Self - How It Works (Coaches)

Future Self turns your athlete's recent training plus your scenario settings into a bounded projection card.

## Coach workflow
1. Open the athlete profile and go to **Future Self**.
2. Set scenario knobs:
   - adherence (70/85/95)
   - volume (-10/0/+10)
   - intensity mode (baseline or +1 hard session/week)
   - taper (7 or 10 days)
3. Click **Run projection**.
4. Review:
   - headline outcome range
   - performance, consistency, and body trend summaries
   - confidence grade and assumptions
5. Toggle athlete visibility per panel.

## What athletes see
- A coach-led message: “Based on your coach’s plan and your recent training…”
- A horizon selector (4/8/12/24 weeks)
- Only the panels you choose to share
- Always-visible disclaimer: projections are estimates, not guarantees

## Confidence and uncertainty
- Every panel includes confidence (A/B/C)
- Wider bands appear when data is sparse or horizon is longer
- Missing data degrades gracefully into directional guidance (never broken UI)

## Important guardrails
- No deterministic promises
- No diagnosis or treatment claims
- No cross-athlete comparisons in V1
